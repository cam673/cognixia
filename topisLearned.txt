I learned how to use git and github

-  To use git, you must install git to your local machine

- You can create a new git repository using the command git init

- To view what branch you are currently on, use the command git branch

- Use git status to see if any new files were added or if any files were modified

- git add applies the changes that were made

- git commit -m "" fully adds the changes to the branch you are located in

- git pull is used to retrieve updated files from the remote repository

- git push applies changes you made to the remote repository
